[{"content":"Ruffly is a cli tool written in Python to copy configuration for tools such as ruff from a source .toml. I typically use a consistent set of tool configurations, think line length, across projects and always ended up copying and pasting from one repo to another. This was a pretty \u0026ldquo;rough\u0026rdquo; process, sometimes I would grab more than I wanted and sometime I\u0026rsquo;d grab configuration for a tool I didn\u0026rsquo;t need. Since most of the settings were for ruff: \u0026ldquo;ruffly\u0026rdquo; seemed a fitting name. This simple package just makes this manual process a litte quicker and adds default configuration if you don\u0026rsquo;t have .toml in mind to copy from.\nThis was the first package I\u0026rsquo;ve published to PyPi and a great learning experience. The project uses Github actions and setuptools to build the package and publish it to PyPi.\nThe package can be found on PyPi here, and the repository on GitHub here.
