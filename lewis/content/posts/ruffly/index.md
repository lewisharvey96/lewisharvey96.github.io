Ruffly is a cli tool written in Python to copy configuration for tools such as [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) from a source .toml. I typically use a consistent set of tool configurations, think line length, across projects and always ended up copying and pasting from one repo to another. This was a pretty "rough" process, sometimes I would grab more than I wanted and sometime I'd grab configuration for a tool I didn't need. Since most of the settings were for ruff:  *"ruffly"* seemed a fitting name. This simple package just makes this manual process a litte quicker and adds default configuration if you don't have .toml in mind to copy from.

This was the first package I've published to PyPi and a great learning experience. The project uses Github actions and setuptools to build the package and publish it to PyPi.

The package can be found on PyPi [here](https://pypi.org/project/ruffly/), and the repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lewisharvey96/ruffly). Below is the key info from the README.
