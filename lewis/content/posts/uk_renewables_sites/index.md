As a bonified energy enthusiast, I often get hung up wonderin who is responsible for the various renewables I spot around the country. Google can be hit or miss but luckily the UK Goverment has a [curated dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-energy-planning-database-monthly-extract) available to scratch just this itch!

Another frequent question asked by the voice in my head is: 

    *"Who are the biggest players across the technologies?"*

We can use the aformentioned dataset to investigate this as well.

### Utility Scale (>5MW) Renewables and BESS sites
With Scotland dominated by wind farms and England by solar, this map should let you find locate which ever site has you in a quandary.

### Top 5 Players by Total Installed Capacity
#### Wind
Scottish Power Renewables and SSE are neck and neck. Even including the huge Viking Energy Wind Farm (SSE SPV) Scottish Power pips them at the post with the inclusion of their joint ventures with CRE Energy.

Scottish Power Renewables are have the largest fleet in the UK. They also operate some of the oldest turbines in the country. This will pose an increasing challenge for the operation and maintenance, but also opportunities for repowering and growth.

#### Solar
Lighthouse Renewable Energy (now owned by BP since 2018) are the leading developer and operator of solar across Europe, so it's no surprise they dominate in the UK.

#### BESS
As the new kid on the block it's still all the play for and the top BESS contendars are jostling for position. Harmony Energy Storage is currently out in front but we can expect new comers like ZÃ©nobe with a large development pipeline to give them a run for their money in future.

### (Extra) A Big Table of the Data
This represent a subset of the government data, namely, only large operational onshore projects. The ones I spend the most time wondering over.
